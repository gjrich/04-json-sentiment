    "## Question 4 \n",
    "Write a function that takes the name of a file that contains song lyrics, loads the file, performs sentiment analysis, and returns the polarity score.  Use this function to print the polarity scores (with the name of the song) of the four files you created in question 3.  Does the reported polarity match your understanding of the song's lyrics? Why or why not do you think that might be?  Answer the questions in either a comment in the code cell or a markdown cell under the code cell."

    "## Analysis of Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. \"Hurt\" (Johnny Cash) - Polarity: 0.067\n",
    "   Surprisingly, this deeply emotional song about pain and regret shows a slightly positive\n",
    "   polarity score. This is a clear example of the sentiment analyzer's limitations. The\n",
    "   song's profound sadness, self-loathing, and themes of addiction aren't properly captured.\n",
    "   Words like \"crown\" (though it's \"crown of thorns\") might be read as positive, while the\n",
    "   complex emotional context is missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. \"I Will Survive\" (Gloria Gaynor) - Polarity: 0.028\n",
    "   This shows a neutral score. While the song\n",
    "   does discuss negative experiences (being dumped, feeling afraid), the main message is about\n",
    "   strength and survival. The almost-zero score suggests the analyzer is averaging out the\n",
    "   negative descriptions of past events with the positive declarations of survival, missing\n",
    "   the overall triumphant message.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. \"Under the Bridge\" (RHCP) - Polarity: 0.221\n",
    "   Oddly, this song about loneliness and addiction has the highest positive score of\n",
    "   the four. This might be due to words about love for the city (\"she sees my good deeds\")\n",
    "   and finding comfort.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. \"Wonderland\" (Caravan Palace) - Polarity: 0.150\n",
    "   While the song is abstract, it uses playful and whimsical imagery. \n",
    "   However, the score is still quite low considering the upbeat nature of the song.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Issues with the Analysis:\n",
    "### 1. Compression of Scores\n",
    "   All scores fall within a very narrow range (0.028 to 0.221),\n",
    "   despite the songs having vastly different emotional tones. This suggests the analyzer\n",
    "   is not effectively distinguishing between strongly positive and negative context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Context Failure\n",
    "   The most striking example is \"Hurt\" showing a positive score despite\n",
    "   being one of the darkest songs in the set. This reveals how the analyzer fails to\n",
    "   understand context and emotional weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Metaphor Blindness\n",
    "   Complex metaphors and poetic language in songs like \"Under the Bridge\"\n",
    "   lead to scores that don't align with the songs' actual emotional impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Narrative Arc Blindness\n",
    "   \"I Will Survive\" demonstrates how the analyzer doesn't capture\n",
    "   the progression from negative to positive, instead averaging everything into a nearly\n",
    "   neutral score.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results suggest that traditional sentiment analysis tools, while useful for\n",
    "straightforward text, may need significant adaptation to be effective for song lyrics,\n",
    "which rely heavily on context, metaphor, and emotional subtext that this NLP\n",
    "model struggled to comprehend.\n",
