    "lyrics": "Just imagine a trip to a wonderful land\r\nOf candy, and jam, and ice cream\r\nI gotta hit that street you better watch it\r\nWith a gat that I cock with a full clip\r\nI got the whip, got the pitch though I'd keep it undercover \n\nAll up in the club, just to live it up\n\nSee the stone cold face, try to knock it\n\nI can't be trapped, never walk, I'm a rocket\n\nI gotta be in it, I gotta trip in it \n\nI gotta be...\n\n\n\nSee the big gold chain that I'm rockin'\n\nI got the ring for the bling, not a problem\n\nI got a stash full of cash that I owe to my brother\n\nAll up in the club, just to live it up\n\nLook how the streets turn cold when I walk it\n\nIt's my rules no man can stop it\n\nI throw a kick so quick that I'll leave you in the gutter\n\nLeave you in the gutter, gutter, gutter...\n\n\n\nAll up in the gut, all up in the gut, all up, all up, all up in the gutter...\n\n\n\nJust imagine, wonderful land\n\n\n\nI know all these things never happen\n\nI'm just a random girl with gentle manners\n\nIn my dreams I rock and I rule the wonderland, rule the wonderland ...\n\n\n\nAll up in the gut, all up in the gut, all up, all up, all up in the gutter..."
