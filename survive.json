You think I'd lay down and die?\n\nOh no not I, I will survive,\n\nOh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive,\n\nI've got all my life to live; I've got all my love to give,\n\nAnd I'll survive, I will survive,\n\nHey, Hey!\n\n\n\nIt took all the strength I had not to fall apart,\n\nAnd trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart,\n\nAnd I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself,\n\nI used to cry, but now I hold my head up high,\n\nAnd you'll see me, somebody new,\n\nI'm not that chained up little person still in love with you,\n\nAnd so you felt like droppin' in and just expect me to be free,\n\nNow I'm savin' all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me. \n\n\n\nGo on now go, walk out the door,\n\nJust turn around now, 'cause your not welcome anymore,\n\nWeren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye,\n\nYou think I'd crumble? You think I'd lay down and die?\n\nOh no not I, I will survive,\n\nOh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive,\n\nI've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give,\n\nAnd I'll survive, I will survive. Oh\n\n\n\nGo on now go, walk out the door,\n\nJust turn around now, 'cause your not welcome anymore,\n\nWeren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye,\n\nYou think I'd crumble? You think I lay down and die?\n\nOh no not I, I will survive,\n\nOh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive,\n\nI've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give,\n\nAnd I'll survive, I will survive, I will survive\n\n\n\nIt took all the strength I had not to fall apart,\n\nAnd trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart,\n\nAnd I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself,\n\nI used to cry, but now I hold my head up high,\n\nAnd you'll see me, somebody new,\n\nI'm not that chained up little person still in love with you,\n\nAnd so you felt like droppin' in and just expect me to be free,\n\nNow I'm savin' all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me. \n\n\n\nGo on now go, walk out the door,\n\nJust turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore,\n\nWeren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye,\n\nYou I'd crumble? D'you think I'd break down and die?\n\nOh no not I, I will survive,\n\nOh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive,\n\nI've got all my life to live; I've got all my love to give,\n\nAnd I'll survive, I will survive,I will survive"
